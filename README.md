<p align="center"><b>TLDR</b>: Contribute <code>BIG D</code>, get <code>F R E E</code> <code>S H I R T</code> <code>M A I L E D</code> <code>T O</code> <code>Y O U</code>!</p>

Many people are daunted by the idea of making a their first contribution on public repositories. Hence, [OpenSUTD](https://opensutd.org/) has created this repository to encourage members of the SUTD community to learn more about open source and GitHub! This shall be a fun and harmless environment for you to make your first contribution on GitHub via **pull requests**.

This month is also [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), which means that you can get a free shirt mailed to you by contributing pull requests! Hacktoberfest is an annual, month-long celebration of open source software run by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and other sponsors. During this month (1 Oct to 31 Oct), contribute **at least four pull requests** to **any** GitHub respository and a **free** Hacktoberfest T-shirt will be mailed to you!

> **Note: you have to be fast, there's only 50,000 shirts available globally!**

### TLDR

1. Create a GitHub Account ([link](https://github.com/))
2. Fork this repository ([help](#forking))
3. Make changes using the online editor ([help](#editing))
4. Submit a pull request! ([help](#submitting))

> **Note: You need to submit at least total of four pull requests (to any repository, not just this one) to qualify for the free Hacktoberfest shirt.**

## Cool, so what can I contribute?

We encourage you to contribute various types and interpretations of `D`s into this repository! 

Examples (just some ideas) of possible contributions:

* Various `D` files (`d.py`, `d.txt` and so on - demonstrate your knowledge of file formats!)
* Funny scripts that do things related to `D`
* Dank stuff, I know we have many meme lords in the crowd
* For more ideas, check the repo or other [contributions](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/DDDDDDDDDD/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+D)!

**Just keep things harmless and safe for work! No indecent contributions will be tolerated**

For more information, take a look at the [Hacktoberfest FAQ](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq).

## Is there a backstory?

This repo? It was loosely inspired by [this legendary GitHub repository](https://github.com/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) ([story here](https://linuxwit.ch/blog/2018/12/e98e/)), but instead of manymany `e`s, we are doing manymany`D`s! Why? Because we're SUTD, and big `D` is our thing, and we want to collect all kinds of `D`s!

This is also inspired by other repositories set up during previous Hacktoberfests to encourage people from all around the globe to make their first public contributions on GitHub and the online open source community. 

## What is OpenSUTD?

OpenSUTD was created to fufill a desire to create a community to:

* provide a way for people to spawn and sustain decentralised initiatives
* promote an organic movement in school to embrace open sharing and collaboration
* maintain a space for free and open knowledge sharing within and outside of the SUTD Community

OpenSUTD is not a fifth row where there is the notion of a member vs non-member. The only thing we recognise is contributions, and anyone can contribute. Contribution is not limited to code! We're always looking out for writers, designers, evangelists, community managers and more.
